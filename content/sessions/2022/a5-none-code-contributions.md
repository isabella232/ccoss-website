A common misconception about open source contributions is that all contributions must be code-based. This ideology has made contributing to Open Source a nightmare for persons with little or no technical experience.
However, experiencing open source goes beyond that. Whether you are a novice in programming, a seasoned developer, or a non-engineer, there are several ways to start your contributions to open-source software beyond code. Contributing to Open Source also serves as a suitable catalyst for personal and professional growth; during this session, I would like to share with you:
- What open source is all about,
- Getting started with Open source
- Contributing beyond code
- Open source as a growth catalyst
- Benefits of contributing to Open source
